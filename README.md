<h3 align="center">So what is Amoung Us</h3>

<p align="left">Amoung us is a game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.</p>

<p align="left"> Because Amoung Us is preety cool game I decided to have some fun with it. I decided to make terminal version of the game. You are the crewmate all the time you have to guess the imposter and you have only 2 turn to guess the imposter</p>
